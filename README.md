# Final-Year-Project
For my final year project, I created a piece of assistive technology to aid with the rehabilitation of paediatric facial burns
patients.

This was primarily done using Unity, and written in C#.

It uses the camera of whatever device you are using to track the movement of the face, which in turn provides the controls 
for different games.

For the best results, use this software in moderately low light, in front of a plain background.
